# muse_platformer
Creating a platformer that runs with the MUSE 2 headset allowing the program to respond to brain data in real time.

The goal is to have a "tilt score" that will accurately(or sort of) determine a change in emotional, especially a negative one using metrics such as lowered HRV, specific Theta/Alpha ratios, low Alpha bandpower and higher Beta bandpower. 

The game loop will then occasionally check the EEG + PPG data to read those factors and score the emotional shifts a player might be experiencing and acting accordingly. I choose to do a platformer because those are the most excruciating 
types of games so it will be fun to see how players react to issues arrising in the game.
